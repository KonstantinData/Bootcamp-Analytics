## Journal Entry | Week 36 | Year 24

The mission has begun. This week was all about setting up my "base camp" tools: SQL, Tableau, Python, and all the necessary platforms I’ll need for my journey. The introduction to data analytics felt like the first mapping attempt of a new world. Concepts like "analytical questions," "data visualization," and "insight generation" started to take on tangible meaning.

It was also a time for self-reflection. Like an interstellar expedition, I had to ask myself whether I was prepared enough to successfully navigate this path. The sheer volume of material and topics felt overwhelming, but I focused on one thing: taking the first step. Data began to reveal itself not just as numbers but as narratives, waiting to be uncovered with the right techniques and tools.

## Journal Entry | Week 37 | Year 24

This week felt like exploring a vast archive. SQL opened the doors to countless datasets. I learned the art of filtering and sorting and took my first steps with aggregation functions, which helped me uncover hidden trends and patterns. Tableau became my ally as I started transforming these insights into dashboards – a visual journey through the world of data.

The challenges lay in understanding the logic behind joins and building connections between tables. It felt like mapping a network of stars, where each node revealed a new connection. By the end of the week, I had not only tools in hand but also a newfound sense of confidence.

## Journal Entry | Week 38 | Year 24

Excel revealed itself as the Swiss Army knife of the data world. I learned how to manipulate data with basic functions and create my first charts to narrate insights. Tableau complemented these skills, enabling me to design interactive dashboards that were not only informative but also visually appealing.

The highlight of the week was storytelling. I realized that data is only as powerful as the story it tells. The challenge wasn’t just understanding the numbers but presenting them in a way that could inspire and convince others.

## Journal Entry | Week 39 | Year 24

This week was all about diving deeper into SQL. Joins became the central challenge. I learned how to link multiple tables and combine data in ways that opened up new perspectives. At the same time, I simulated my first real-world business scenarios, using SQL to solve problems.

In Tableau, I began refining my visualizations and experimenting with interactive dashboards. It felt like learning to play a new instrument – the more I practiced, the more confident I became.

## Journal Entry | Week 40 | Year 24

Advanced visualization techniques with Tableau took center stage. I delved deeper into dashboards and began integrating interactive filters. These tools allowed me to view data from different perspectives and gain deeper insights.

At the same time, I worked on optimizing my workflows in SQL. It was a week of fine-tuning, solidifying the basics while making small progress in more complex topics.

## Journal Entry | Week 41 | Year 24

Python – the language that brings data to life. Starting with programming felt like learning a new way to communicate. Variables, loops, and functions opened up new possibilities for manipulating data and automating processes.

At the same time, my SQL skills deepened further. The combination of these tools felt like building a bridge between two worlds – the visual and the programmatic.

## Journal Entry | Week 42 | Year 24

The second week with Python was intense. I was introduced to Pandas and began transforming chaotic datasets into structured tables. Learning data cleaning techniques was challenging but immensely rewarding when the results became visible.

In SQL, aggregation was the focus. The connection between Python and SQL became increasingly clear, and I started identifying scenarios where both tools could combine their strengths.

## Journal Entry | Week 43 | Year 24

This week was all about visual experimentation. Tableau showed me how to tell complex stories by using various visualization techniques. Meanwhile, I continued building my Python skills and began writing my first scripts for data pipelines.

It was also the week I worked on my first practice project. This project brought together all the skills I had learned so far, showing me how much progress I had made in just a few weeks.

## Journal Entry | Week 44 | Year 24

Career preparation took center stage. My LinkedIn and GitHub profiles got a facelift, and I started working on my digital footprint. I also began practicing best practices for interviews and learning how to present my projects convincingly.

Work on SQL and Tableau projects continued. My goal was to create a portfolio that clearly and effectively showcased my skills.

---

## Journal Entry | Week 45 | Year 24

Data cleaning and automation were the main themes. With Python and Pandas, I was able to efficiently clean unstructured data and prepare it for analysis. At the same time, I started creating automations that made my work easier.

SQL grew more complex as I delved into window functions. This week showed me how deep and versatile data analysis can be.

---

## Journal Entry | Week 46 | Year 24

With Tableau and Python, I created my first end-to-end solutions. From data extraction to cleaning to visualization, I was able to build a complete pipeline. This experience was not only technically valuable but also motivating as I could see the tangible results of my work.

At the same time, I started working on my first portfolio dashboard. It was a preview of what I aim to showcase in future interviews.

---

## Journal Entry | Week 47 | Year 24

This week felt like piecing together a puzzle. Python, SQL, and Tableau started to form a cohesive whole. Working on my portfolio was intensive but rewarding. I completed my first dashboards and analyses, which I now proudly consider part of my presentation material.

It was also a week of reflection. I realized how far I’ve come and felt more motivated than ever to continue this journey.
